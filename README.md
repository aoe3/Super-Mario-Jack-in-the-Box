# Super-Mario-Jack-in-the-Box

This project was inspired by the coin boxes found in almost every game involving Mario. For reference, see: https://youtu.be/TC_UZSdupb4?t=54s

I laser cut a cube out of acryllic, as well as a coin attached to a lever. Upon hitting a flex sensor (The frame was not strong enough to let users punch it, like in the games), The coin, attached to a servo, would pop up!

Here's a video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch1gSx-4hiA (The first minute is all that's really needed... but feel free to watch until the absolute end!)

You can see the code and circuitry in the other files.
